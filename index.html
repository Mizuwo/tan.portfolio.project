                    Ever since I was a child, I have been captivated by the world of computers and programming. As I grew older, my fascination with technology evolved into a passion for software development. I embarked on my journey into the world of game development when I entered college, fueled by my love for creating interactive experiences. <br>
                    <br>
                    However, due to unforeseen financial challenges, I had to put my college education on hold. Despite this setback, my determination to pursue my dreams in technology never wavered. I made the decision to shift my focus to web development‚Äîa field that not only allows me to showcase my programming skills but also provides a pathway to continue my college education. <br>
                    <br>
                    Now, as I embark on this new chapter as a web developer, I am eager to leverage my programming expertise to create impactful and user-friendly websites. I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that not only meet client needs but also push the boundaries of creativity and innovation. <br>
                    <br>
                    By choosing to work with me, you can expect dedication, attention to detail, and a relentless drive to excel. I am not just pursuing a career; I am pursuing my passion and striving to make a meaningful impact in the digital world. <br>
                    In addition to programming, I am also a digital artist. I have a strong affinity for visual storytelling and enjoy bringing ideas to life through digital illustrations and designs. My artistic background complements my technical skills, allowing me to approach web development with a creative perspective.
